OUR LEARNING MODEL
</div>
<br></br>
<h1> OUR MISSION</h1>
<p> Our unique learning model puts you first. Drive the bulk of your learning experience individually and with your peers through engaging and meaningful activities.

    We have developed a Learning Cycle that helps students learn new skills and master concepts. This 4-part Learning Cycle incorporates the need to discover gaps in your knowledge and skillset, self-paced learning, peer learning (students teaching and learning from each other) and facilitated group learning. Every stage of the Learning Cycle is incorporated into the classes you take in your Leadership Core.
